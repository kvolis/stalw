`s`imple `t`ools that `a`re so `l`acking in `w`ork

## Description
This package provides simple tools that are often missing from the standard library when developing. 

All of them, of course, have been created many times in various packages, Iâ€™m just collecting them in one. The tools-set can be very subjective, but I will be glad if it is useful to you.

This package will be updated from time to time and new tools will be added.
